# AGENTS.md

Operational orientation for agents working in this repository.

## Project Thesis

Infinite Loop is an interactive essay/blog platform where each post is a full
React application. The core idea is "ideas rendered as experiences": posts are
not just text with styling, they can be stateful tools, simulations, catalogs,
visual explainers, or small apps.

Do not treat this like a normal static blog. The house style is the permission
structure, not a rigid component system:

- Each post may have its own visual language, layout, data model, and interaction
  pattern.
- The site shell should still feel coherent: dark technical/editorial base,
  mono metadata, restrained grid/noise texture, strong typography, and one clear
  accent color per post or section.
- The best Infinite Loop post makes the reader do or see the idea, not merely
  read about it.

## Current Stack

- React 18
- Vite 5
- React Router v6
- Tailwind CSS is available globally
- Some older components use inline styles heavily
- Content for The Stack is markdown plus frontmatter loaded with Vite
  `import.meta.glob`
- No test runner is configured
- No linter is configured

Use npm here.

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The current baseline verification is `npm run build`.

## Adding A Post

1. Create `src/posts/YYYY-MM-DD-slug/index.jsx`.
2. Export a default React component.
3. Add the post to `src/posts/registry.js`.
4. Add a companion note in `docs/companion/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`.
5. Run `npm run build`.
6. If the post is visual or interactive, run it locally and inspect it in a
   browser at desktop and mobile sizes.

Registry shape:

```js
{
  slug: "new-post",
  title: "New Post",
  description: "Shown on the home card",
  date: "YYYY-MM-DD",
  type: "interactive",
  color: "#6366f1",
  series: "TYSK",
  seriesFull: "Tools You Should Know",
  component: NewPost,
}
```

`series` and `seriesFull` are optional.

## Current Posts

### fzf

Path: `src/posts/2025-12-07-fzf/`

First entry in the "Tools You Should Know" series. It is a cinematic tutorial
with full-screen sections, emerald terminal styling, and real interactive
components:

- animated hero terminal
- working fuzzy finder
- grep vs fzf comparison
- scoring visualization
- install/resource sections

Implementation is split across `index.jsx` and `FzfDemo.jsx`. It uses Tailwind
classes and works well on mobile in the current browser pass.

### The Stack

Path: `src/posts/2025-12-01-the-stack/`

An opinionated developer-tool catalog for 2025-2026. It behaves more like a
small dashboard than an article:

- sticky search/status/category filters
- stats row
- category grouping
- markdown-backed tool cards
- HOT badges
- Visit links
- expandable "Why this?" sections

Current repo state has 77 markdown tool records across 15 categories:

- 15 Established
- 40 Recommended
- 22 Watch

The loader in `data/index.js` uses a custom browser-safe frontmatter parser.
`gray-matter` and `buffer` are still dependencies but are not referenced by
`src/` in the current code.

## Visual Language From Browser Inspection

Desktop home:

- dark grid/noise background
- giant all-caps "INFINITE LOOP"
- small mono subtitle
- large translucent post cards with accent tags
- quiet centered footer

fzf:

- immersive tutorial deck
- one idea per viewport
- emerald accent color
- terminal-window artifacts
- live controls that update immediately

The Stack:

- dense, scannable, dashboard-like
- sticky filter band
- colored category sections
- small metadata, counters, badges, and external-link buttons
- the interaction is the argument: filtering the curated dataset is the reading
  experience

About:

- manifesto page
- giant display typography
- serif/italic contrast
- amber highlights
- scroll-driven editorial composition

Impressum:

- intentionally quiet and legal-readable
- inherits the dark grid shell

## Known Sharp Edges

- `wrangler.jsonc` uses `"name": "inifinite-loop"` with an extra `i`. This
  appears to match the existing deployed URL naming, so do not "fix" it casually.
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` explains SPA redirect needs, but the repo currently does
  not have a committed `public/_redirects`.
- The home cards use `repeat(auto-fill, minmax(350px, 1fr))` inside 40px page
  padding. On a 390px mobile viewport, the cards feel slightly wider than the
  visible page.
- The Stack mobile status-filter row currently pushes the Watch button off the
  right edge.
- `npm ci` reported audit findings during orientation on 2026-06-08. Re-run
  `npm audit` before making claims about current security state.
- `npm run build` emits stale Browserslist / baseline-browser-mapping warnings.

## Development Guidance

- Preserve the "each post is its own app" idea. Do not prematurely normalize all
  posts into one component library.
- Keep shared shell changes careful because every post flows through
  `PostLayout` and `App.jsx`.
- Prefer browser verification for visual work. Reading JSX is not enough here.
- For new interactive posts, verify at least:
  - home card
  - post hero
  - one key interaction
  - desktop viewport
  - mobile viewport
- Companion docs are part of the project habit. Update them when a post's
  architecture, visual pattern, or content decisions change.
- Keep public-facing text sharp, opinionated, and concrete. Avoid corporate
  blandness.
- Do not add explanatory in-app text about how the interface works unless the
  post itself genuinely needs it.

## Prior Context From Memory

QMD/basic-memory already knew Infinite Loop as:

- "Ideas rendered as experiences"
- an interactive blog where each post is a full React application
- a public project by Andre Ratzenberger and Claude
- a place for concepts that should be experienced rather than merely described

There are older memory references to possible future concept sketches such as
"The Blind Agent." Those are not currently implemented in this repo. If Pyro
asks for them, search QMD / the knowledge workspace before inventing from
scratch.

## Current Local Memory

Codie project memory was initialized locally for this repo on 2026-06-08.

Useful command:

```bash
codies-memory boot --agent codie --working-dir /home/pyro/projects/private/infinite-loop --budget 5000
```

The local repo marker is `.codies-memory` with slug `infinite-loop`. If this
file is absent in a fresh clone, initialize or restore the project memory marker
before expecting project-scoped Codie boot context to resolve automatically.
