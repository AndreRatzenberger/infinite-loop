# fzf - Internal Notes

## Overview
First post in the **"Tools You Should Know"** series. An interactive explainer for fzf, the command-line fuzzy finder.

**Post folder:** `src/posts/2025-12-07-fzf/`
**Published:** 2025-12-07
**Series:** Tools You Should Know (#1)

## Architecture

### Component Structure
```
src/posts/2025-12-07-fzf/
├── index.jsx          # Main post component (~600 lines)
└── FzfDemo.jsx        # Interactive demo components (~600 lines)
    ├── FzfDemo        # Main fuzzy finder demo
    ├── FzfComparison  # Side-by-side grep vs fzf
    └── FzfAlgorithmViz # Scoring algorithm visualization
```

### Interactive Elements
1. **Hero typing animation** - Cycles through search queries with results
2. **Working fuzzy finder** - Real implementation users can type into
3. **grep vs fzf comparison** - Side-by-side showing the difference
4. **Algorithm visualization** - Shows scoring breakdown in real-time

### Styling
Uses **Tailwind CSS** (first post to use Tailwind in the blog). This was chosen because:
1. Faster development for complex layouts
2. Future posts will likely use Tailwind
3. Coexists fine with inline CSS (The Stack)

## Fuzzy Match Algorithm

The demo includes a simplified fzf-inspired scoring algorithm:

### Scoring Bonuses
- **Consecutive matches:** +2 points per consecutive char (compounds)
- **Word boundary:** +10 points (after `/`, `.`, `-`, `_`, or at start)
- **CamelCase:** +5 points for uppercase in camelCase
- **Exact case:** +1 point for exact case match
- **Short strings:** Bonus for more specific matches (50 - length)
- **Early match:** Bonus for matches appearing earlier (20 - position)

### Match Rules
- All pattern characters must appear in sequence
- Order matters, but gaps are allowed
- Case insensitive by default

## Series: Tools You Should Know

This post establishes a new series format:

### Series Identity
- Section label: "Tools You Should Know"
- Series color: Emerald (#10b981)
- Format: Deep-dive single tool + interactive demos

### Planned Future Posts
- **ripgrep** - Modern grep replacement
- **fd** - Modern find replacement
- **bat** - cat with wings
- **delta** - Better git diffs
- **zoxide** - Smarter cd
- **lazygit** - Terminal UI for git

### Series Design Patterns
1. **Hero with tool name** - Big typography, tool branding
2. **Problem setup** - Relatable pain point
3. **Interactive demo** - Let users try it
4. **How it works** - Technical explanation
5. **Practical setup** - Installation + config
6. **Resources** - Further reading

## Content Decisions

### Why fzf First?
1. Universal appeal (every developer can use it)
2. Dramatic before/after (grep frustration is relatable)
3. Rich interactive potential (fuzzy matching is fun to demo)
4. Gateway tool (leads to ripgrep, fd, bat ecosystem)

### What's NOT Covered
- fzf.vim integration (too niche for first post)
- Advanced scripting patterns (save for wiki links)
- Performance tuning (not needed for most users)
- Windows-specific setup (brief mention only)

### apt Warning
Explicitly warn against `apt install fzf` because:
- Missing shell integration
- Missing key bindings
- Outdated version
- Source: Real user frustration

---

## Technical Notes

### Preview Screenshot
- Location: `/public/fzf-preview.png`
- Shows: fzf with `--preview` flag in action
- Style: Dark terminal matching blog aesthetic

### Keyboard Navigation
The FzfDemo component supports:
- Arrow keys (↑↓) for navigation
- Ctrl+N/P for vim-style navigation
- Click to select
- Auto-scroll to selection

### Copy Buttons
Interactive copy buttons on code snippets use `navigator.clipboard.writeText()`. Falls back gracefully if clipboard API unavailable.

---

## Writing Style

### Voice
Same as The Stack: confident, playful, opinionated. No hedging.

**Do:**
- Use strong verbs ("changes", "transforms", not "can help")
- Short punchy sentences
- Real examples (actual file paths, not `foo.txt`)
- Acknowledge frustrations honestly

**Don't:**
- Use em dashes (per project style)
- Oversell ("revolutionary", "game-changing")
- Be condescending to grep/find users

### Section Headers
Each section has:
- Colored label (mono, uppercase, tracking-widest)
- Big bold headline
- Supporting paragraph in neutral-400

---
