## Architecture (Updated 2025-12-01)

### Data-Driven Design
The post now uses a markdown-based content system instead of hardcoded data:

```
src/posts/2025-12-01-the-stack/
├── index.jsx              # Pure UI component (~600 lines)
└── data/
    ├── index.js           # Loader with browser-safe frontmatter parser
    ├── languages/         # 5 tools
    ├── terminal/          # 5 tools
    ├── ide/               # 7 tools
    ├── ai-tools/          # 4 tools
    ├── infrastructure/    # 5 tools
    ├── databases/         # 4 tools
    ├── cloud/             # 3 tools
    ├── frontend/          # 2 tools
    ├── apis/              # 2 tools
    ├── observability/     # 3 tools
    ├── security/          # 2 tools
    ├── testing/           # 4 tools
    ├── docs/              # 2 tools
    ├── hosting/           # 7 tools
    └── up-and-coming/     # 22 tools
```

### Markdown Format
Each tool is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: Tool Name
status: Recommended
link: https://example.com
hot: true
why: Short rationale for "Why this?" section
---

The full description goes here. Write in Pratchett-fun style.
```

**Field reference:**
- `name` (required): Display name
- `status` (required): "Established" | "Recommended" | "Watch"
- `link` (optional): URL for Visit button
- `hot` (optional): Shows HOT badge if true
- `why` (required): Short text shown in expandable section

### Adding New Tools
1. Create markdown file in appropriate category folder
2. Follow the frontmatter schema above
3. Done. No code changes needed.

### Loader Implementation
The loader (`data/index.js`) uses a custom browser-safe frontmatter parser (no Node.js dependencies like gray-matter). It:
1. Uses Vite's `import.meta.glob` to load all `.md` files
2. Parses frontmatter with regex
3. Derives category from folder name
4. Sorts by category order

## Writing Style

### Voice
Pratchett-esque wit without being cringe. Fun, not biting. Confident and direct, but playful.
130 words max per card

**Do:**
- Use unexpected analogies ("like an overenthusiastic golden retriever")
- Anthropomorphize tools/languages ("Pandas walked so Polars could sprint")
- Self-aware tech humor ("Written in Rust, because apparently that's the law now")
- Short punchy sentences mixed with longer explanatory ones

**Don't:**
- Use em dashes (user hates them, use periods or parentheses instead)
- Hedge ("maybe", "perhaps", "I think")
- Be mean-spirited or dismissive
- Overexplain jokes

### Example Transformations

**Before (too terse):**
> "Pandas had its time. Polars is the future."

**After (Pratchett fun):**
> "Pandas walked so Polars could sprint. Lazy evaluation means it won't try to load your entire dataset into memory like an overenthusiastic golden retriever. The API is what you'd design if you started fresh today instead of building on top of fifteen years of 'well, it made sense at the time.' Also Rust-based, because apparently that's the law now."

## Design Decisions

### Card Layout
- Grid of cards with category grouping
- Expandable cards show "Why this?" rationale
- HOT badge for trending/exciting tools
- Visit button (↗) in top right corner for direct resource access

### Visit Button Placement
Originally placed inside expanded content. Moved to top-right corner because:
1. Users shouldn't need to expand to get the link
2. Reduces friction to resource discovery
3. Subtle by default, lights up on hover with category color

### HOT Badge + Link Coexistence
When both exist, HOT badge shifts left (`right: 70px`) to make room for the Visit button at `right: 12px`.

### Color System
Each category has its own color palette defined in `categoryColors`:
- `bg`: Background tint
- `border`: Accent border color  
- `text`: Text color for labels

### Status Icons
- ◆ Established (green) - Battle-tested, industry standard
- ● Recommended (indigo) - Current best choice
- ◐ Watch (orange) - Up and coming, worth tracking
