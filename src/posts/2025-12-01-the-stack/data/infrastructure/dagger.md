why: Programmable pipelines, test locally, escape YAML hell

CI/CD pipelines written in real programming languages instead of YAML that's been asked to do too much. Define your pipeline in Go, Python, or TypeScript.

Made by the folks who built Docker, who apparently felt bad about what they unleashed and decided to fix it.
