Docker Desktop for Mac, but fast, light, and without the licensing drama. Starts in seconds instead of minutes. Uses a fraction of the memory. Includes Kubernetes if you need it. The kind of software that makes you wonder what Docker Desktop was actually doing with all those resources. macOS only, but if you're on Mac and still using Docker Desktop, you're missing out.
