why: Visual staging, interactive rebase, conflict resolution

Git in the terminal, but you can actually see what you're doing. Visual staging that makes 'git add -p' feel like cave painting. Interactive rebasing without memorizing arcane commands. Merge conflict resolution that doesn't require a PhD in diff notation. If you've ever stared at a terminal wondering 'did that commit work?' this is the answer. Bonus: watch your colleagues' jaws drop when you resolve a hairy merge in 30 seconds.
