Docker without the daemon. Rootless containers by default, which means better security and no 'docker group' shenanigans. CLI is basically identical to Docker, so your muscle memory transfers. Red Hat backs it, which means enterprise support exists if your compliance team asks. For Linux users (or anyone tired of Docker's business model pivots), this is the answer.
