why: Real programming languages, actual abstractions, import existing resources

Infrastructure as Code, but the code is actually code instead of HCL pretending to be code. Write your infrastructure in Python, TypeScript, Go, or C#. Use real loops, real conditionals, real functions. Import existing cloud resources without crying. Terraform did the hard work of proving IaC matters; Pulumi did the obvious next step of making it not painful to write.
