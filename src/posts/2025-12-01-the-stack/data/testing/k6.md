Load testing used to mean learning a specialized tool that nobody on your team actually understood. Or worse, clicking through a GUI that couldn't be version controlled.

k6 said: what if load tests were just JavaScript?

Write your scenarios in JS or TypeScript. Run them from the CLI. Commit them to git. Review them in PRs. Integrate them in CI/CD. Store results in Prometheus or Grafana or wherever you already put your metrics. The mental model is "it's just code" and the execution model is "Go makes it fast."

The 2024 releases added native TypeScript support, modern ES6+ features, and globally available timer methods. No more transpilation steps. No more bundling ceremonies. Just write modern JavaScript and run it.

Spike tests, stress tests, soak tests, browser-based performance tests. k6 handles them all with minimal resource consumption because it was built from scratch for high-load scenarios. The extension ecosystem means you can adapt it to whatever weird infrastructure situation you've gotten yourself into.

Performance testing as code. Finally.
