Selenium taught us that browser automation is possible. Playwright taught us it doesn't have to hurt.

One API for Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. Auto-waiting that eliminates the flaky test plague. Browser contexts that spin up faster than you can say "test isolation." And when tests do fail, the trace viewer captures everything: screenshots, DOM snapshots, network requests, console logs. Debugging becomes archaeology with excellent tools instead of desperate guesswork.

The codegen feature deserves its own standing ovation. Click through your app, watch Playwright write the tests for you, then refine. It's like pair programming with someone who never gets tired of clicking buttons.

Microsoft built this as the evolution of Puppeteer, and it shows. The ergonomics are superb. The documentation is comprehensive. The GitHub Copilot agent uses Playwright MCP to actually verify its code changes in a live browser. When AI reaches for a tool to interact with the web, it picks Playwright.

Cross-browser E2E testing finally works. That's the whole pitch. That's enough.
