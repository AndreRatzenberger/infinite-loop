Mitchell Hashimoto (the Vagrant/Terraform/Consul guy) spent years building a terminal from scratch in Zig. Just hit 1.0 in late 2024. GPU-accelerated rendering that makes your terminal feel like it's running on actual hardware instead of through molasses. Cross-platform, native, and from someone who's earned the benefit of the doubt.
