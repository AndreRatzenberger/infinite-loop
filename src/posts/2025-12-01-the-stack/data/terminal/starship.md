A prompt that works with any shell and shows you exactly what you need: git status, language versions, cloud context, kubernetes cluster. Written in Rust (drink!) so it's fast enough that you won't notice it's doing anything. Infinitely configurable for the tinkerers, perfectly fine out of the box for everyone else.
