What if tmux had been designed by someone who thought 'maybe users shouldn't need to memorize arcane key combinations?' Visual layout editor, floating panes, a plugin system that doesn't require a PhD, and defaults that don't assume you've been using terminal multiplexers since 1987. It's tmux for people who have things to do.
