The modern replacements for Unix commands that were written when 'fast' meant 'finishes before lunch.' zoxide remembers your directories so you don't have to. eza makes ls actually pleasant to look at. bat is cat with syntax highlighting and wings. ripgrep and fd make grep and find feel like they're running on a potato. fzf fuzzy-finds everything. Install all of them. You're welcome.
