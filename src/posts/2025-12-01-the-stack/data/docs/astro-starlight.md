Documentation frameworks are a graveyard of good intentions. Starlight is the resurrection.

Built on Astro, it inherits that framework's superpower: ship zero JavaScript by default, add interactivity only where needed. Your docs load fast because there's nothing to load. Search is built in via Pagefind. Dark mode works out of the box. The sidebar generates automatically from your file structure. Internationalization is a first-class concern, not an afterthought.

Drop Markdown files into a folder. Watch a beautiful documentation site materialize. That's the core loop, and it's genuinely delightful. Need more power? MDX lets you embed React, Vue, Svelte, or Solid components directly in your docs. Your interactive examples live next to your explanations.

The theme editor means matching your brand takes minutes, not days. Accessibility features are baked in rather than bolted on. And because it's Astro under the hood, you can deploy anywhere: Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, a static file server from 2004.

Still technically beta, but iterating rapidly with a responsive team. For documentation sites that need to look professional without requiring a professional, Starlight delivers.
