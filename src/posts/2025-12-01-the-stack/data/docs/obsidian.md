why: Plain files, git-friendly, bidirectional links

Your notes should outlive the app that created them.

Obsidian understood this fundamental truth and built accordingly. Everything is Markdown files in a folder on your computer. No proprietary format. No mandatory cloud sync. No "export" feature needed because there's nothing to export from. Your knowledge base is just files, and files are forever.

But plain text alone is just text. Obsidian adds the network. Bidirectional links connect ideas without requiring hierarchy. The graph view reveals patterns you didn't know existed. Block references let you compose thoughts from fragments. Backlinks show you every place an idea appears without you having to remember.

The plugin ecosystem is vast because the architecture invites extension. Task management, daily notes, Kanban boards, database-like tables, Vim keybindings, Git integration. The community has built tools for nearly every workflow, and because everything is local Markdown, nothing is locked in.

Free for personal and commercial use. Sync and publish are paid services but entirely optional. Your second brain, owned by your first brain, running on your own computer. Revolutionary, apparently.
