Six keystrokes: `surge` and Enter. That's the entire deployment process. No dashboard, no config files, no account creation ritual. Just point it at a folder and it's live. Free SSL on surge.sh subdomains, custom 404 pages, and the kind of Unix philosophy purity that makes greybeards weep with joy. The $30/month Plus tier adds password protection and redirects, but the free version handles 90% of "I just need this online right now" situations. Maximum results, minimum ceremony.
