They put Node.js in your browser. Not a simulation, not a subset. Actual Node.js running via WebContainers, booting in milliseconds, installing packages 5x faster than local npm. Share a link and your collaborator has your entire dev environment instantly. The 2024 Bolt.new launch combined this with AI to let you prompt entire apps into existence. TutorialKit turns docs into interactive playgrounds. Safari and Firefox support means it actually works everywhere now. The future of "works on my machine" is "works in everyone's browser."
