why: 500 builds/month free, unlimited bandwidth, global edge, connects to Workers/D1/R2

Git push, coffee sip, site's live on 300+ edge locations worldwide. The free tier is almost suspiciously generous: unlimited bandwidth, unlimited sites, 500 builds per month, no credit card theatrics. Connect it to Workers for serverless functions, D1 for SQL, R2 for storage, and suddenly you've got a full backend without ever leaving Cloudflare's ecosystem. The $5/month paid tier exists mainly because some people feel guilty about getting too much for free.
