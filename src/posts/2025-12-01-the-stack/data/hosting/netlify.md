why: Forms handling, split testing, good free tier, serverless functions

The OG of drag-and-drop deploys. Before Vercel made it cool, Netlify was already doing git-based deployments with preview URLs. Forms that just work without a backend, split testing for the indecisive, and serverless functions when you need a sprinkle of server. The free tier gives you 100GB bandwidth and 300 build minutes. They've moved to credit-based pricing in 2025, which is either clearer or more confusing depending on how you feel about credits. Still the reliable choice when you just want things to work.
