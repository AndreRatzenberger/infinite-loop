Cloud development before cloud development was cool. Devboxes spin up full VMs in 1.5 seconds using memory snapshotting magic. Fork any environment in 2 seconds for parallel experimentation. Built-in Docker, AI assistant, and deployment previews that hibernate when idle and wake instantly when accessed. Together AI acquired them in late 2024, betting big on the "code interpreter" future. The free tier includes 40 hours of VM time monthly. Not as browser-native as StackBlitz, but handles heavier workloads when you need real virtualization.
