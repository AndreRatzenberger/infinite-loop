The company that made Next.js also made the place where Next.js runs best. Preview deployments for every pull request, edge functions that cold-start faster than you can complain about cold starts, and a dashboard so polished it makes you feel like a better developer. They've pivoted from "Frontend Cloud" to "AI Cloud" in 2025, shipping v0 for AI-generated UIs. The free tier handles most side projects. The pricing gets spicy at scale, but by then you're hopefully making money.
