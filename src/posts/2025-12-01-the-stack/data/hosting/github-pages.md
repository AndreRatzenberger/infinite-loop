why: Custom domains, Jekyll built-in, already where your code lives

Your repository already lives on GitHub. Your static site might as well too. Free hosting for public repos, custom domains with automatic HTTPS, and Jekyll built in if you're into that. GitHub Actions can build anything else. No separate deploy step, no external service to configure. Push to main, site updates. It's not the fanciest, lacks edge functions and serverless bells, but for documentation sites, portfolios, and project pages, it's been quietly reliable since 2008. Sometimes the simplest solution is the one you already have.
