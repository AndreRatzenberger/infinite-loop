Open-source terminal AI that plays nicely with git. Makes changes, commits them with sensible messages, and lets you review diffs before accepting. Works with Claude, GPT, or local models. The 'architect mode' plans changes before implementing, which prevents the AI from going on tangents. For those who want AI assistance without vendor lock-in or giving up their terminal workflow.
