Anthropic's terminal-native coding agent that treats your codebase like it actually read it (because it did). Point it at a problem, watch it explore files, form a plan, and execute changes across multiple files with the kind of reasoning that makes you slightly uncomfortable about job security. Best at complex refactoring, architectural decisions, and the kind of 'figure it out' tasks that would take you an afternoon of context-gathering. Yes, this essay was written with it.
