The one that started the whole 'AI writes your code' thing. Integrated into basically every editor now. Good at autocomplete, reasonable at explaining code, occasionally hallucinates function signatures that don't exist. Think of it as a very fast junior developer who sometimes confidently makes things up. The $10/month is worth it for the autocomplete alone, even if you never touch the chat features.
