If data is the new oil, Grafana is the refinery that turns crude metrics into something you can actually use.

Connect it to Prometheus, VictoriaMetrics, InfluxDB, Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL, CloudWatch, or roughly a hundred other data sources. Build dashboards that would make Edward Tufte weep tears of informational joy. Alert on thresholds, anomalies, or that creeping dread feeling you get when p99 latency starts climbing.

Grafana 11 brought queryless exploration of Prometheus metrics, AI-powered panel summaries, and a complete architecture rewrite that makes dashboards more dynamic without changing how they look. The Scenes library means future versions can support multiple time ranges per dashboard, nested variables, and panels organized into tabs. The boring visualization tool got interesting again.

The plugin ecosystem is vast. Community dashboards number in the thousands. And while Grafana Labs would love to sell you their cloud platform, the open source version remains genuinely open and genuinely capable. It's the Switzerland of observability: neutral, reliable, and everyone trusts it with their data.
