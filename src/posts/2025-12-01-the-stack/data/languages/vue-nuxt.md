why: Better DX than React, more coherent ecosystem, Composition API cleaner than hooks
---

The Composition API is what React hooks wanted to be when they grew up. Reactivity that actually makes sense, without the eighteen useEffect footguns. Single-file components keep your HTML, CSS, and logic together like civilized code should be. Nuxt adds the meta-framework layer without the existential dread of Next.js configuration.
