why: Rust-based, lazy evaluation, modern API

Pandas walked so Polars could sprint. Lazy evaluation means it won't try to load your entire dataset into memory like an overenthusiastic golden retriever. The API is what you'd design if you started fresh today instead of building on top of fifteen years of 'well, it made sense at the time.' Also Rust-based, because apparently that's the law now.
