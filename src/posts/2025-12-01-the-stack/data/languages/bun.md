why: Built-in TypeScript, test runner, bundler, all faster

Jarred Sumner looked at the Node.js ecosystem (the separate package manager, the TypeScript compiler, the test runner, the bundler) and asked 'what if one thing did all of this, but fast?' Built on JavaScriptCore instead of V8, and it shows. Deno tried this too, but Bun actually committed to Node compatibility.
