why: VS Code compatible, best AI integration, multi-file aware

A VS Code fork that went all-in on AI and somehow didn't fumble it. Import your existing VS Code config and extensions, then discover what happens when the AI actually understands your whole codebase instead of just the current file. The .cursorrules file lets you teach it your project's conventions. Version 2.0 brought multi-agent workflows. Half the Fortune 500 apparently uses this now, which is either a ringing endorsement or a sign we're all doomed. Probably both.
