Vim, but the developers actually merge pull requests. Lua configuration replaced Vimscript (good riddance), native LSP support makes it a proper IDE, and Tree-sitter provides syntax highlighting that doesn't fall apart on complex files. The learning curve is still 'keyboard-shaped cliff,' but if you survive, you'll edit text faster than people who use a mouse. LazyVim or AstroNvim provide sensible defaults if you'd rather not spend a weekend on your config.
