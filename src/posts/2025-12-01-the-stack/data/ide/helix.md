why: Selection-first, built-in LSP, works out of box
---

A modal editor that looked at Vim's 30 years of accumulated configuration wisdom and asked 'what if we just... built in the good parts?' Selection-first editing (select text, then act on it) turns out to be more intuitive than Vim's verb-first approach. LSP support out of the box. Tree-sitter for syntax. No plugin manager to configure, no init.lua to maintain, no YouTube tutorials required. Just works.
