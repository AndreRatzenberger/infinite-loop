why: Native performance, no extension hunting, from Atom creators

Built by the team that made Atom, who then watched Electron eat their creation's performance alive and said 'never again.' Native Rust, GPU-rendered, and fast in a way that makes VS Code feel like it's wading through syrup. AI assistant built in, real-time collaboration that actually works, and a growing extension ecosystem. This is what happens when people who understand editors decide to build one without compromise.
