The 'I have a job and my company pays for tools' option. IntelliJ for Java, PyCharm for Python, WebStorm for JavaScript, and so on. Refactoring that actually works across your entire codebase. Debugging that doesn't make you want to cry. Code analysis that catches bugs before you even finish typing them. Yes, they're heavy. Yes, they cost money (though Community editions exist). But when you need to rename a method used in 47 files across 12 modules, you'll understand why people pay.
