Codeium's answer to Cursor, billing itself as 'the first agentic IDE.' The Cascade feature maintains context across your entire codebase, which sounds like marketing speak until you use it. Free tier includes unlimited access to their SWE-1 Lite model, making it the budget-conscious choice for AI-assisted coding. Less polish than Cursor, but 'free' is a compelling feature.
