The default. The baseline. The thing everything else compares itself to. Microsoft took the 'Electron apps are slow' criticism personally and made it work anyway through sheer engineering willpower. Extensions for everything, GitHub Copilot integration if you want it, and a user base so massive that any problem you encounter has already been solved on Stack Overflow. It's not exciting, but neither is gravity, and gravity gets the job done.
