EdgeDB (now rebranded as Gel) asked: what if we built a better interface on top of Postgres instead of replacing it? EdgeQL is what SQL would look like if designed today: composable queries, nested objects instead of JOINs, no NULL (empty sets instead). Links replace foreign keys, making relationships first-class. Every query compiles to a single optimized SQL statement. TypeScript codegen means your types match your schema automatically. Version 6.0 added PostGIS, auth webhooks, and AI features. If you've ever written a complex JOIN and wondered "why is this so hard," EdgeDB is your answer.
