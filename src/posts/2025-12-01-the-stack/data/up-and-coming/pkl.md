why: Better than YAML, validation, IDE support
---

Apple open-sourced a configuration language and it's actually good. Pkl (pronounced "Pickle") treats config as code: classes, functions, conditionals, type constraints, and validation rules. Generate output as JSON, YAML, XML, or Java Properties. Define a schema once, validate everywhere, catch errors before deployment instead of at 3am. IDE support with autocomplete and error highlighting. The question is Apple's commitment history (remember Mach-O?). But as YAML configurations grow into incomprehensible monsters, Pkl offers a typed, validated, composable alternative. Configuration deserves better than stringly-typed chaos.
