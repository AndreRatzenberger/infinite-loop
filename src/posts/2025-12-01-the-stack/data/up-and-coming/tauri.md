Electron, but make it not terrible. Tauri wraps your web frontend in Rust, using the OS native webview instead of bundling Chromium. The result: 600KB apps instead of 150MB monstrosities. Version 2.0 (stable December 2024) added iOS and Android support, multi-webview windows, and a new permission system. Over 17,700 Discord members and production deployments from startups to enterprises. The team put 2,870+ work hours into 2.0 alone. If you need desktop apps with web tech but can't stomach shipping a browser with every install, Tauri is now the obvious choice.
