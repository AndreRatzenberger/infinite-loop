The language Bun chose when it needed to be fast. Zig is what happens when you redesign C from scratch, keeping the low-level power while adding comptime (compile-time code execution that replaces macros), no hidden allocations, no hidden control flow, and error handling that's actually pleasant. Cross-compiles to basically anything, including producing C. The toolchain moved away from LLVM dependency toward self-hosting. In 2025, the team migrated from GitHub to Codeberg. Stack Overflow says Zig developers earn $103k average. The 1.0 release is "coming soon" for values of soon measured in patience.
