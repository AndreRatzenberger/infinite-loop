Jupyter notebooks are broken. Over 75% on GitHub don't run, 96% don't reproduce. Marimo fixes this with reactive execution: change a cell, and all dependent cells update automatically. No hidden state, no "restart kernel and run all" prayers. Notebooks are stored as pure Python (git-friendly!), executable as scripts, and deployable as web apps with one command. Built-in sliders, tables, and AI assistants. The catch: you'll need to rewire your brain for reactivity, and you can't redefine variables. But once you adapt, there's no going back to Jupyter's chaos.
