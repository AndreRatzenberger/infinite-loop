why: If you prefer Go, native performance

Tauri's spiritual cousin for Go developers. Wails wraps your web frontend with a Go backend, using the native OS webview instead of Chromium. The result: 4MB binaries that run with minimal memory, compared to Electron's 100MB+ behemoths. Built-in hot reload, TypeScript definitions auto-generated from Go, native dialogs and menus. Templates for React, Vue, Svelte, and more. The limitation: no cookie support complicates auth flows. But if you're a Go developer who needs desktop apps without learning Rust (Tauri) or shipping Chrome (Electron), Wails hits the sweet spot.
