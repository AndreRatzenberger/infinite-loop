why: Database branching, scale to zero, great DX

Vercel for databases. Neon separates Postgres storage and compute, enabling things that shouldn't be possible: database branching (copy-on-write in seconds, not hours), scale to zero (stop paying when idle), instant point-in-time restore. Branch your production database for CI/CD, run tests, discard or merge. The Data API (2025) gives you PostgREST-compatible REST endpoints automatically. Now generally available on Azure. If you're building serverless apps and tired of databases that don't understand "scale to zero," Neon speaks your language. The DX is genuinely delightful.
