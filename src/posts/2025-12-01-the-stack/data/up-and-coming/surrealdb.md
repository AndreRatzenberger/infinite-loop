why: Single query language, real-time subscriptions

What if you didn't need separate databases for documents, graphs, time series, and vectors? SurrealDB combines all of them with SurrealQL, a SQL-like language that handles graph traversals without learning Cypher. Real-time subscriptions over WebSockets, ACID transactions, geospatial queries, full-text search. Runs as a single node or distributed cluster. Written in Rust (of course). Version 2.0 landed in 2025 with better graph relationships and performance. Raised $20M Series A. The "ultimate multi-model database" pitch is ambitious, but if it works, you're replacing three databases with one.
