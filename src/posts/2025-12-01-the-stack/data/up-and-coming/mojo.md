why: Uses MLIR, native Python compat, game-changing for AI

Chris Lattner (Swift, LLVM) built a Python superset that's 35,000x faster than Python in benchmarks. Not a typo. Mojo compiles via MLIR to target CPUs, GPUs, TPUs, and custom accelerators without separate codepaths. Write familiar Python syntax, add type annotations where it matters, and suddenly your ML code runs at C++ speed. The standard library went open source in 2024. Full GPU programming support landed for NVIDIA and AMD. The catch: the compiler itself remains closed source. Still, if you're doing serious AI work, this is the language to watch.
