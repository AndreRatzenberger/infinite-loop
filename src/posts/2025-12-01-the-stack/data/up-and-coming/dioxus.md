why: Better desktop than Leptos, cross-platform
---

React's API, Rust's safety, and a target list that includes web, desktop, and mobile from a single codebase. Dioxus apps compile to 50KB web bundles and sub-5MB desktop binaries. Hot reload works across platforms. The signals-based state management borrows the best ideas from React, Solid, and Svelte. Version 0.6 added full mobile support with direct JNI and native API access. Backed by FutureWei and the GitHub Accelerator. Where Leptos focuses on web, Dioxus bets on true cross-platform. If you want "write once, run everywhere" without Electron's baggage, this is the Rust answer.
