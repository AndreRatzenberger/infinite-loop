why: 100k req/sec, 20MB binary, growing fast

Rails, but for Rust. Loco brings convention over configuration to the Rust ecosystem: generators, migrations, background jobs, mailers, authentication, the whole DHH playbook. Built on Tokio and Axum, it benchmarks around 100,000 requests/second for simple endpoints, 50,000 with database calls. Binaries clock in around 20MB. The "one person framework" philosophy means a solo developer can ship production apps without drowning in boilerplate. If you've ever wished Rails was faster and typed, or that Rust was more productive, Loco sits exactly at that intersection.
