What if Erlang's legendary concurrency met a type system that didn't make you cry? Gleam hit 1.0 in March 2024 and immediately landed second place (after Rust) in Stack Overflow's 2025 "most admired" rankings. It runs on the BEAM VM that powers WhatsApp, inheriting battle-tested actor concurrency and supervision trees. Also compiles to JavaScript for when you need to share code with the frontend. The toolchain is a single Rust binary: compiler, formatter, package manager, language server. No separate installation step for each. Functional programming that doesn't require a PhD to enjoy.
