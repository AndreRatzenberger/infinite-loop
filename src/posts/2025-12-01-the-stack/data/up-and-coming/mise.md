Every project needs Node 18, Python 3.11, and Go 1.21. You've got nvm, pyenv, and goenv cluttering your shell. Mise (pronounced "meez") replaces all of them with a single Rust binary that's 10x faster than asdf. Version switching takes 5ms instead of 120ms. It also handles environment variables (replacing direnv) and runs project tasks. Compatible with asdf plugins, so you get the ecosystem without the overhead. Windows support actually works, unlike asdf. One tool, one config file, every language. The version manager wars are over; Mise won by doing everything faster.
