Full-stack web development in Rust, for people who looked at JavaScript fatigue and said "hold my memory-safe beer." Leptos brings fine-grained reactivity (like Solid.js) to the Rust ecosystem with SSR, hydration, and streaming HTML out of the box. Server functions let you call backend code from the client without manual API wiring. The component model feels surprisingly ergonomic for Rust. Runs on Axum or Actix. The tradeoff: Rust's compile times mean your iteration loop is slower. But if you're building something where type safety and performance really matter, Leptos delivers both.
