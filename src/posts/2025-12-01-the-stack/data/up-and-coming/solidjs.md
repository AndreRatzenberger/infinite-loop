why: True reactivity, smaller bundles, faster than React
---

React's fine-grained reactive cousin that doesn't pretend the virtual DOM was ever a good idea. Solid uses signals for state, meaning updates flow directly to the exact DOM nodes that need changing. No reconciliation, no diffing, no wasted renders. Components run once at setup, then pure reactivity takes over. The JSX looks familiar but behaves completely differently under the hood. In 2025, Angular and Preact adopted signals too (flattery by imitation). Solid's bundles are smaller, runtime is faster, and the mental model is cleaner once you stop thinking in React.
