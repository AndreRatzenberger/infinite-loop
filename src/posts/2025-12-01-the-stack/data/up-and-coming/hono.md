The web framework for people who think Express is bloated (because it is). Hono ("flame" in Japanese) runs the same code on Cloudflare Workers, Deno, Bun, AWS Lambda, Vercel, and Node.js. The tiny preset is under 14KB with zero dependencies. The RegExpRouter is one of the fastest in the JavaScript ecosystem. Cloudflare uses Hono internally for D1 and Workers Logs. If you're building APIs for the edge where every kilobyte and millisecond counts, Hono delivers maximum performance with minimum ceremony. Created in December 2021, now the go-to for edge-first development.
