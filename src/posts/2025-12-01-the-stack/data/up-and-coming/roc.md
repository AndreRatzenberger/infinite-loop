why: 100% type inference, purity inference, highest risk/reward

Richard Feldman loved Elm so much he made a spiritual successor that works beyond the browser. Roc is pure functional programming with 100% type inference (you never have to write a type annotation), purity inference (it figures out side effects automatically), and error messages so friendly they practically apologize. Already used in production at Vendr. The team is targeting Advent of Code 2025 for the new compiler. Recently migrated from Rust to Zig for the host language. High risk, highest reward: if Roc clicks, it's programming's future.
