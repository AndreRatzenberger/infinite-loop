why: Thoughtworks Tech Radar, Vercel/Zendesk use it

TypeScript's escape hatch from "errors as any" purgatory. Effect gives you Rust-style typed errors, dependency injection, retries, timeouts, and concurrency primitives in a composable functional style. The Effect<A, E, R> type explicitly declares what a function returns, what errors it can throw, and what dependencies it needs. Vercel and Zendesk use it in production. Thoughtworks put it on their Technology Radar in 2025. The API stabilized with version 3.0. The learning curve is real (it's basically a new way of thinking), but if you're tired of untyped chaos, Effect is the grown-up answer.
