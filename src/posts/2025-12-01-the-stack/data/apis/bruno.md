why: Collections as files, no cloud account, open source

Postman became the thing it swore to destroy: bloated enterprise software that wants your email, your credit card, and probably your firstborn's API keys.

Bruno is the rebellion. Open source, offline-first, and blissfully account-free. Your collections live in plain text files on your filesystem, versioned with Git like civilized code. No cloud sync means no cloud sync fees, no vendor lock-in, and no explaining to security why your production credentials are on someone else's servers.

The format is human-readable. Your collections are just folders. Your requests are just files. When your teammate makes a change, it shows up in the PR diff like any other code review. Revolutionary concept: treating API definitions as code.

Yes, it lacks some Postman features. No request chaining. No mock servers. No AI assistant that definitely isn't training on your data. But it does the core job of testing APIs extremely well, runs entirely on your machine, and costs exactly zero dollars regardless of team size.

Sometimes the best feature is all the features that are deliberately missing.
