why: Better console, BigQuery, Cloud Run simplicity

Google Cloud is what happens when engineers who use their own products design a cloud platform. The console actually makes sense. The documentation assumes you're intelligent. The error messages occasionally help you fix things.

Cloud Run deserves special mention: give it a Docker container, get back a URL that scales to zero when nobody's looking and scales to infinity when everyone is. No Kubernetes certificates to earn, no YAML indentation nightmares to debug at 2 AM. Just containers in, requests out, sanity preserved.

BigQuery remains the crown jewel for analytics. Throw petabytes at it, get answers back in seconds, pay only for what you query. It's the data warehouse for people who have actual data problems, not people who want to cosplay having data problems.

Across 40 regions and 121 zones, GCP offers the hyperscaler reliability you'd expect, but with a developer experience that doesn't actively resent your existence. In a world of AWS's 400 services and Azure's enterprise complexity, sometimes boring competence is exactly what you need.
