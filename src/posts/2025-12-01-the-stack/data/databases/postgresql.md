why: Extensions ecosystem, battle-tested, can do everything

The database equivalent of "nobody ever got fired for choosing IBM." Except PostgreSQL actually deserves its reputation. Thirty years of development, an extension ecosystem that can turn it into a graph database, a time-series database, a vector database, or probably a toaster if someone wrote the extension. ACID compliance that doesn't flinch. JSON support that makes MongoDB nervous. The kind of reliability where "it just works" isn't marketing copy, it's a factual statement. Every shiny new database eventually gets compared to Postgres, and most of them lose.
