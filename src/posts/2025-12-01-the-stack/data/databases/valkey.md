why: Linux Foundation backed, truly open source, drop-in Redis replacement
---

In March 2024, Redis decided open source was more of a suggestion than a commitment and changed their license. The community response was swift and decisive: within a month, Valkey was born, adopted by the Linux Foundation, and had a production-ready release. AWS, Google, Oracle, Alibaba, and nearly 50 other companies jumped ship. It's a drop-in replacement for Redis, meaning your existing code works unchanged. Valkey 8.0 already includes features Redis doesn't have. The lesson? When you relicense an open source project, the community might just fork you into irrelevance. Sometimes the fastest route to success is making your competitor do something stupid.
